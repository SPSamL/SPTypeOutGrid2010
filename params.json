I converted an ASP.Net GridView that was inside an UpdatePanel to an editable grid that used Knockout data-binding.  I used TypeScript because I'm still trying to get the hang of properly structured JavaScript when it comes to complex, MV* framework architectures...plus, the Intellisense is GREAT!  This was all built for a SharePoint 2010 farm project so that's what this is wrapped up in.  The underlying Knockout and TypeScript should work just fine, or with minimal tweaks, if SharePoint isn't your thing.\r\n\r\n## Project\r\nThe sample project is a very watered-down professional athlete contract tracker.  There's are lists for Contracts and Contract Options.  The assumption is that an athlete signs a contract for a set number of years and can have additional player or team options.","google":"UA-64294200-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
